 we will create a neural network type classification model for the TMNIST dataset. We will use various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, and keras to read in the data, explore it, prepare it for modeling, build and train a neural network, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results. This tutorial will serve as a great starting point for those who are new to neural network type classification and want to learn how to create and train a basic neural network model. By following the step-by-step guide, you will be able to create your own neural network type classification model for the TMNIST dataset and gain insights into how to evaluate and visualize the model's performance.

Dataset - This dataset is inspired by the MNIST database for handwritten digits. It consists of images representing digits from 0-9 produced using 2,990 google fonts files. This file consists of 29,900 examples with labels and font names. Each row contains 786 elements: the first element represents the font name (ex-Chivo-Italic, Sen-Bold), the second element represents the label (a number from 0-9) and the remaining 784 elements represent the grayscale pixel values (from 0-255) for the 28x28 pixel image.
